        <p>You can look at font icons here: <a href="/tiny/ligatures">Font icon ligatures</a></p>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>There are two reasons why I got interested in reasearching about this topic.
First of a lot of google products loads garbage when you are not using super
fast internet speeds. The main most noticeble one used to gmail but it looks
like they fixed it now.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/google-icons/image/analytics-icons-font-not-loaded.png" alt="Analytics icons font not loaded"></p>
<p>But even though it was annoying it didn&rsquo;t spark enough enterest to go and dig
deeper to understand reasons behind it. The main reason was me misclicking on an
icon and selecting just a portion of it. It looked like this:</p>

    
<video height="400px" controls>
    <source src="/posts/google-icons/video/google-font-icon-select.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.  
</video>



<h2 id="reasons">Reasons</h2>
<p>The &lsquo;information&rsquo; icon from the above video is added to the page like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;i class=&#34;google-material-icons VCmZ8 kdYqFe&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;info_filled&lt;/i&gt;
</code></pre><p>At the beginning I thought that &lsquo;info_filled&rsquo; text inside the tag is used as a
&lsquo;helper&rsquo; text to show information when images are not loaded but examining css
classes attached to the tag didn&rsquo;t reveal any background image being applied to
this tag.</p>
<p>In reality they used ligatures for icon rendering with &lsquo;Material Icons
Extended&rsquo;. I knew about icon fonts but using ligatures for that never crossed my
mind.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know, using ligatures is a technique to render a &lsquo;unified&rsquo; symbol
when certain combination of letters/codepoints go one after another (not exactly
but good enough here). For example when when two equal signs, ==, are placed
next to each other only one long equal sign rendered instead of two short ones.</p>
<p>In the example from the video letter combinatio for <strong>&lsquo;info_filled&rsquo;</strong> is
combined into single icon. The reason why I could select that icon is related to
how browser does it selection. In this example chromium renders one icon but
behind the scenes it sees them as a collection of letters. You can select middle
part and paste it into a text editor and see exact letters.</p>
<h2 id="libreoffice">Libreoffice</h2>
<p>If we try the same trick in libreoffice (or probably microsoft office) it has
the same properties. In the video below I use the same font to render text. The
video show similar behaviour of rendering one symbol but during selection it
select just parts of it.</p>

    
<video height="400px" controls>
    <source src="/posts/google-icons/video/google-font-icons-select-libreoffice-writer.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.  
</video>



<h2 id="inkscape">Inkscape</h2>
<p>Inkscape does similar for rendering but selection works on the whole icon.</p>

    
<video height="400px" controls>
    <source src="/posts/google-icons/video/google-font-icons-select-inkscape.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.  
</video>



<p>In both examples you can see how it works when with icons that are part of a
bigger combination. For example when I type &lsquo;facebook&rsquo; with the material font I
first get a &lsquo;face&rsquo; icon and then it converts &lsquo;facebook&rsquo; icon.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-font-material-icons-font">About the font &lsquo;Material Icons&rsquo; font.</h2>
<p>I downloaded a version of &lsquo;Material Icons&rsquo; in woff2 format as in that website.
It weighs 227.2 KiB and contains 3000+ icons in it. This give around 60 bytes
per icon which sound pretty good when you consider throughput.</p>
<p>There is a list of strings that could be used on the google material page but I
wanted to have a look into it myself. For this I used python with <strong>&lsquo;fonttool&rsquo;</strong>
package. Then I with this tiny script I got all multiletter used for for
ligatures:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>from fontTools.ttLib import TTFont
font = TTFont(&#39;google.woff2&#39;)
for k,v in font.getBestCmap().items():
    print(v)
</code></pre><p>This will give back a list of &lsquo;words&rsquo; that could be used in the as icons. There
single letter icons too (for example &lsquo;g&rsquo;) but I ignored those. Here is a list of
some of those combinations.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>error
error_outline
warning
add_alert
notification_important
qr_code_2
flutter_dash
align_vertical_top
align_horizontal_left
bnagent
align_horizontal_center

gke_protect

</code></pre><h2 id="is-this-approach-good">Is this approach good?</h2>
<p>I understand the reasoning behind using this technique. They wanted to use an
upgraded version of forgotten technique of &lsquo;css sprites&rsquo;. It should be better as
it is in vector format and only one version is good enough for any kind of
screen size but in practice it is horrible. Especially for a website it takes
some time to load those 200+ Kb of data just to start rendering icons. It is
especially bad when you use just 10 icons on a page but wait to load 3000.</p>
<p>It looks like even google understood its mistake as if you go to Gmail it no
longer uses this font. Now the switched bad to &lsquo;inneficient&rsquo; png icon one by one
loading  and it worked.</p>
<h2 id="extra">Extra</h2>
<p>To my surprise the icon that drove my attention was unique on &lsquo;search console&rsquo;
page. So that 200+ Kb font file is used just to draw 1 (sic!) icon(there might
be more but I found only one). Then how are the other are drawn? Here is how the
drawing is split:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/google-icons/image/search-console-icon-types.png" alt="Four ways to draw icons"></p>
<p>There are 2 different icon fonts, inline svg icons and a bit of CSS tricks. This
is one icon that uses CSS border trick to make a bottom triangle icon. &lsquo;Google
Material Icons&rsquo; we have looked at in this article. The last is &lsquo;Material Icons
Extended&rsquo;. It is different in that if you look at the source code it does not
have word combinations as ligatures but and what looked like an empty space.
When I looked in the developer console it was just span with a white space.
After copying it to vscode it also was a white space. So I copied it to vim to
get its extract it whitespace code and got this:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/google-icons/image/vim-code.png" alt="Vim code"></p>
<p>So for some of the icons instead of ligatures they used unicode chars which
loaded specific icons from the second font file. In the picture above they were
drawn as square boxes because I blocked that font file and my system didn&rsquo;t have
appropriate font to draw them (but font in vim still knew how to draw them).</p>
<p>It is google and they probably know what they are doing but I am glad I don&rsquo;t
have to deal with this variaty in my projects.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>So I finally spent some time to look into the font drawing issue and found the
reasons behind huge ugly text on many of googles products. The reason behind it
was usage of ligatures and text descriptions for the icons. It looks like that
this approach is an overkill and actually worsen the user experience. And in
some critical projects google fixed this by removing this &lsquo;icon drawing with
font&rsquo; approach (gmaail now only pull png icons).</p>
<p>This approach could be a good solution in mobile or desktop apps as you can bake
that font into the app itself but for websites it is debatable.</p>
