        <h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p>From the beginning, C/C++ code has been compiled into separate small code
objects and later linked into one executable or library. Initially, it was done
due to hardware limitations as it couldn&rsquo;t process all code simultaneously. These
days it is done to increase compilation speed by trying to compile just a small
portion of changed code after the initial full build.</p>
<p>For my own smaller C projects I have been using <strong>unity build</strong> and were doing
full project rebuild. I do it just for convenience and it is easier to
manage and build for my purposes. There are people &ldquo;on the internet&rdquo; who claim
that even a larger C++ project could have been built using unity build without
much increase in compilation times. Even though I am a bit skeptical that this
could be done on a larger scale I was interested in measuring actual timings.</p>
<p>Initially, I was planning to generate 500k-1m lines of C/C++ code with a bunch
of functions calling each other and spread across 1000-2000 files. I was
hesitating because it would be a synthetic code and it felt a bit fishy. Then I
decided to take an open-source project and try to build it as a single
compilation unit. I chose Inkscape as I already use it weekly for my design
works and had plans to dig into its source code later to make some experiments.
It felt like an ideal candidate.</p>
<p>Lately, I have been trying to make estimates before doing measurements and for
this project my initial expectations were to get 2x-3x speedup in single-core
compilation of the whole project.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-unity-build">What is unity build?</h3>
<p>Unity build (unified build) is a compilation method for C/C++ projects where
multiple translation units are merged into one and compiled as a single block of
code. The easiest way to do it is by using the preprocessor <strong>#include</strong> directive to
include multiple C/C++ files. This gives us one file which is passed to
the compilator and it will compile it in one go.</p>
<p>In regular builds, we include header files in unity builds we include C/C++ files
directly. So for a regular build, we will have multiple intermediary <strong>.o</strong> files
which later will be linked into an executable while in unity builds preprocessor
merges all files and the compiler creates an executable directly.</p>
<p>Regular builds works something like this:
<img src="/posts/cpp-unity-compile-inkscape/images/regular-build.png" alt="C++ Regular build"></p>
<p>And unity builds look like this:
<img src="/posts/cpp-unity-compile-inkscape/images/unity-build.png" alt="C++ unity build"></p>
<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<p>Initially, I just cloned inkscape&rsquo;s code from <a href="https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape">https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape</a>,
created a &lsquo;build&rsquo; directory inside that repo and from within the &lsquo;build&rsquo; directory run
these commands.</p>
<p><strong>Regular inkscape build with cmake</strong></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>cmake ..   #  4.724 sec
make       #  1938.98s user 144.20s system 99% cpu 34:47.83 total
</code></pre><p>So our baseline is just a little shy of 35 minutes to compile a whole inkscape
from scratch using regular cmake/make combination. Running &lsquo;cloc src&rsquo; gives us
1317 C++ files with 453842 loc, 1287 header files with 93914 loc, and 76 C files
with 51776 loc.</p>
<p>My initial attempt was to try to figure out compilation steps from reading CMake
files and later Makefiles. After some reading, I realized that I don&rsquo;t know enough kung fu
to untangle all the compilation graphs without errors. An easier approach for me
was to get a compilation log from a regular cmake then make compilation steps
and just recreate it from in a bash script. I chose to go with a bash script
because I wanted to explicitly list all the steps and try not to miss anything.</p>
<h3 id="building-without-cmake">Building without cmake</h3>
<p>To begin the process of preparing a unity build I decided to make a regular build
but without cmake or make. For this, I used plain bash script and compiled each
translation unit separately but taking log output from cmake build and building
compiling one by one.</p>
<p>During regular inkscape builds it builds 2 dynamic libraries <strong>lib2geom.so</strong>, <strong>libinkscape_base.so</strong>,
and 10 statically linked libraries <strong>liblivarot_LIB.a, libutil_LIB.a, libuemf_LIB.a,
libcroco_LIB.a, libdepixelize_LIB.a, libavoid_LIB.a, libcola_LIB.a, libvpsc_LIB.a,
libautotrace_LIB.a, libgc_LIB.a</strong>.  libinkscape_base.so is a main library which
contains most inkscape code. In the end we just compile <strong>inkscape-main.cpp</strong>
and link it with all previously mentioned libraries and get a single binary.</p>
<p>Here is the script used to build it: <a href="/posts/cpp-unity-compile-inkscape/files/build-inkscape.sh.txt">build.sh</a>.
It is a 2300-line script file with a bit of setup and then one by one build
translation units into libraries and then into single binary. If you want to try
it you will need to put this script into the root folder of inskcape project and
just run it with <code>./build.sh</code></p>
<p>This one is created on linux and won&rsquo;t work on windows, it will require
small changes to run Mac and you might need to add missing libraries. It will
create __build folder, create libraries and then an executable named <strong>inkscape</strong>
inside that __build folder. Also, it will copy some data files required for
running the executable. In this script, I replicated build libraries used in
regular cmake build and here also measured how much time it takes to build. Here
are the results:</p>
<p><strong>Single build.sh</strong></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Copy data files: 2.127 seconds

</code></pre><p>Regular cmake build took 34 minutes and with new build.sh we built it in just 27
minutes. I am not sure what affected this 7-minute speed-up. It should not be
a file cache because two different builds were done from separate folders and I
cleared the file memory cache before building. (I hope that it is related to cmake
create makefiles that are less efficient and not that I missed some files)</p>
<p>As a result we created 1043 <strong>.o</strong> files, 10 <strong>.a</strong> statically linked files, 2
<strong>.so</strong> dynamic libraries and one executable file. During script execution we
did 1431 calls to <strong>g++</strong>, 61 calls to <strong>gcc</strong>, one explicit call to <strong>ld</strong>, 10
calls to <strong>ar</strong> for static linking.</p>
<h3 id="unity-build">Unity build</h3>
<p>Now that we managed to build inkscape with just inkscape we can assume that it
is more or less possible to move to unity build as we see all the steps
involved. Initially, I wanted to take <strong>inkscape-main.cpp</strong> and with assistance
from compiler errors change the source code to be built in one go. After some time I
found that it was too cumbersome to go this way so I chose a different
approach. I created <strong>all.cpp</strong> file which contained only #include directives
which included all files from the previous script. It looks something like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>#include &#34;../__generated/inkscape-version.cpp&#34;
#include &#34;async/async.cpp&#34;
#include &#34;colors/cms/profile.cpp&#34;
#include &#34;colors/cms/system.cpp&#34;
#include &#34;colors/cms/transform.cpp&#34;
#include &#34;colors/color.cpp&#34;
#include &#34;colors/document-cms.cpp&#34;
#include &#34;colors/dragndrop.cpp&#34;
...
...
...
</code></pre><p>Then with the help of the compiler, I did <strong>&ldquo;Monkey patching&rdquo;</strong> by changing the source
code just enough to make it compile. I didn&rsquo;t study inkscapes architecture as it
was my first time working with this code base and I didn&rsquo;t want to spend a lot
of time in this step. I also didn&rsquo;t do a full unity build by joining all files
into one big unity build. This time I tried to keep each library as it is
defined by inkscape as a separate compilation unit. This was supposed to help me
speed up my experiment development. So as a result of this choice, we got 12
translation units, 11 libraries, and 1 final program unit. Each library has it&rsquo;s
own all_*.cpp file.</p>

</code></pre><p>Total build time took about 3 minutes. Comparing it with the first cmake build it is
almost a 12x increase in single-core compilation when compared with our
custom build.sh build it is 9x speed up in build time. As a result we get 10 .o
files, 10 .a static libraries, 1 .so dynamic library, and 1 executable. Maybe
in the future, I should try to make just one compilation unit but for this case,
it was not a deal breaker.</p>
<p>Main inkscape code is within 877 C++ files. It is built with simple:
<strong>c++ $CFLAGS_MAIN $SRC/all.cpp -o inkscape $LDFLAGS</strong>. So we set some
Compilation and linker flags and just compile <strong>all.cpp</strong> file. How big is it?
The file itself if not very big 878 lines but if we pass -E flag to the compiler
to do just preprocessing we will get a file that is a file that is over 1
million lines with just above 760k actual code lines. This is a compbination of
all those 877 C++ files plus all project and external library headers.</p>
<p>You can look at the changed source code for unity build here: <a href="https://github.com/hereket/inkscape-unity-build">https://github.com/hereket/inkscape-unity-build</a></p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>
<p>Initially, I estimated 2-3x speed up for unity builds but in the end we got 9-12x
speedup. Of course, this is still not enough and doing regular builds is still
faster for normal development because we can use ccache and utilize all cores
for the build by using make. But it was a fun little experiment and it is a good
base for me to do some other experiments.</p>
<p>C files were very fast to build and some C++ features increased compilation
speeds quite a bit. I assumed it is templates that inkscape actively uses in
its codebase. To see if C files are compiled faster I preprocessed compilation
units into separate files and did some LOC (lines of code) measurements. This
LOC is not the number of C++ lines but rather the number of lines after merging all
header/source files into one (including external library headers).</p>

</code></pre><p>At first glance, it looks like that C is not compiled faster but that creates a
lot more stuff to compile. From the table, it looks like the average is compiler
compiles 59k lines per second. If we remove 168k l/s then the average speed is 48k
l/s. If we remove 20k versions then the average speed is 54k lines per second for
unity builds.</p>
<p>Addtionally I decided to measure speed based not on preprocessed output of
source files but on actual lines code of the C/C++ files and their headers. For
this I went to the folders of the correspoing libraries and run &lsquo;cloc&rsquo; inside
those folders. After I took a sum of real lines of C/C++ code and their headers.
Then only issue here is that it was too much work to figure out all &ldquo;our&rdquo; header files
required for inkscape main executable an just calculated lines of code only of
comiled C/C++ files <strong>without</strong> header files. So with this we get lines
of code per second relative to actually &ldquo;our&rdquo; written code without counting
external library headers and generated extra code by the preprocessor (macro
expansion and etc). Here is the table.</p>

</code></pre><p>With this table we can see that C files are &ldquo;faster&rdquo; to compile mostly because
there are just less extra stuff included and generated which leads to increased
percived speed.</p>
<p>This is the initial rough back on the envelope calculation. I might add more data
later if I get more free time to play around.</p>
<h3 id="extra-additional-comparisons">Extra: Additional comparisons</h3>
<p>Since there were a confusion in initial post and some people thought &ldquo;Unity
build rocks let&rsquo;s only it&rdquo; and &ldquo;Make is better. Run it with more threads&rdquo; I
decided to add a bit more measurements. I just want to remind that I was not
trying to argue that unity builds are better or worse. My goal was to make a
simple research into the topic on a real project and have some baseline numbers
to work on later.</p>
<p>Bellow is measurements of compiling inkscape from scratch using different
methods. Before each build I cleared file cache from memory.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>cmake .. &amp;&amp; make | 34 min 52 sec
cmake .. &amp;&amp; make -j 12 | 5 min 48 sec
cmake .. -GNinja &amp;&amp; ninja | 5 min 50 sec

build.sh NON unity (-O0) | 26 min 52 sec
build.sh NON unity (-O2) | 32 min 12 sec
build.sh NON unity (-O3) | 31 min 08 sec

build.sh unity (-O0) |  2 min 57 sec
build.sh unity (-O2) |  6 min 08 sec
build.sh unity (-O3) |  6 min 17 sec
</code></pre><p>And this is what what incremental build compares to full build. In the table
below I measured how much time it take to rebuild project when I change 1 lines
of code in &ldquo;src/io/resource.cpp&rdquo; in homedir_path() to return constant string.
Also I did a test for a header file where I changed one line by adding one more
element to Type enum. Here are the results:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Change one line in  src/io/resource.cpp
ninja      | 2.7 sec
make       | 7.8 sec
make -j 12 | 5 sec

Change one line in  src/io/resource.h
ninja      | 43 sec
make       | 3 minute 30 sec
make -j 12 | 46 sec
</code></pre><p>Regular unity build will still be 2+ minutes for full rebuild for inkscape no
matter what file you change. Building using make/ninja is variable.  As you can
see from the table above it could be very fast or it could take half the amount
required for a full unity build. I guess if I changed several c++ files and headers
it could take close a to time of a full build. There are claims that a project
of this size written in C style without template and other features should
compile in under 10 seconds but I don&rsquo;t have project that I can use to verify
that.</p>
