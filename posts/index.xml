      <description>Introduction This is post is similar to the one about building flutter but a bit different. Actually this one was writter a few years prior to writing flutter version but just never got published. Since then some steps has changed and I moved to Java 11. But you if you still build with java 8 old build method is still surprisingly functional.
So the idea is to build and APK file which then can be installed on an android phone without using gradle and doing each step &amp;ldquo;manually&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Initial draft
Introduction Flutter is a very useful framework which does quite a lot of heavy lifting and hides all the dirty details inside a black box. It is very good when you want get the job done but I really like opening black boxes as I really don&amp;rsquo;t like magic.
The sole reasoning behind this project is to build a &amp;lsquo;hello world&amp;rsquo; project with as few steps as possible and in the end build an apk file which could be installed on an android phone.</description>

      <description>What happened? So I create this site to test some ideas this time I chose to use a &amp;lsquo;static site&amp;rsquo; approach. There is no specific reason why I chose it to be this way it is just I wanted to try something that I have not tried before. My last test was with django.
So one of my first experiments I wanted to do is to stack different web analytics tool on the page and see how they behave and report data for later comparison.</description>

      <description>Start Hello. Initial post in this site. Currently the plan is to use it to test diffent technologies, write some thoughts and share some hobby projects. At the same time I am planning to practice my writing skills.
My plan is to publish a lot of raw content without deep work on it but we will see how it turns out to be.</description>
