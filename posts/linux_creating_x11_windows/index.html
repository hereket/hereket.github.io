        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this post I wanted to go over creating windows using raw <strong>Xlib (X11)</strong> and show
how to approach the task if you want to do it from scratch. Current trend is to
use Wayland and a lot of distros already switched to using it but still there
are a very large portion of computers that are using <strong>X11</strong>.</p>
<p>When I first was learning how to open working with <strong>X11</strong> it was very problematic
to find any tutorial that clearly showed basics and allowed me to start playing
around quickly. Reading documentation is possible but takes a lot of time and
effort. Other tutorials looked like introduced too much moving parts and was a
bit complex for fresh and uninformed mind.</p>
<p>Here I will try to show how to create windows peace by peace with slowly
increasing complexity. But each peace should be self sustained and you can
choose which ever suits your needs.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>:This is is not a tutorial how to create create GUI apps for linux and if you are
not sure what to use then this post is definetely not for you. Go look for Qt or
something similar.</p>
<h2 id="01-opening-simple-window">01. Opening simple window</h2>
<p>Here is the simplest way to open a window <strong>01_simple_window.c</strong>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>#include &lt;X11/Xlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main()
{
    Display* MainDisplay = XOpenDisplay(0);
    Window RootWindow = XDefaultRootWindow(MainDisplay);
    
    Window MainWindow = XCreateSimpleWindow(MainDisplay, RootWindow, 0, 0, 800, 600, 0, 0, 0x00aade87);
    XMapWindow(MainDisplay, MainWindow);
    XFlush(MainDisplay);

    for(;;) { sleep(1); }
}
</code></pre><p>We can compile this code with: <code>gcc 01_simple_window.c -o 01_simple_window -lX11</code></p>
<p>The only thing that we need is to link with X11 using <strong>-lX11</strong> flag during
compilation and need to include <strong>&lt;X11/Xlib.h&gt;</strong> in order to give our program
access to Xlib function definitions.</p>
<p>In order to open our simple window we need just five function from Xlib.</p>
<ul>
<li>XOpenDisplay</li>
<li>XDefaultRootWindow</li>
<li>XCreateSimpleWindow</li>
<li>XMapWindow</li>
<li>XFlush</li>
</ul>
<p>First of all with XOpenDisplay we get a value for current Display. If we had
multiple displays we could have provided display name as a (char*) argument to the function. But since
we are using a default one we can just pass 0 (a.k.a NULL) and Xorg will get
default display name from <strong>$DISPLAY</strong> environent variable.</p>
<p>After that we get a <strong>root</strong> window. We need it to because window (except root
window) must have a parent. So we get a main window to parent our window under
it.</p>
<p>For this example we user <strong>XCreateSimpleWindow(&hellip;)</strong> to create our window. For
parameters it takes <strong>display, parent, x, y, width, height, border_width,
border</strong> and <strong>background</strong>. X and Y are offset in the screen that we want to
show our window. Width and Height are dimensions for the window. Border andd
Background are int&rsquo;s that describe colors. Window manager could ignore X, Y,
Width, Height and Border values and use whatever values it wants. My window
manager (openbox) opens window with correct width and height but ignores the
rest. The pixel color value is a 4 byte integer value with first byte being not
important and the rest are <strong>red, green and blue</strong> values of the colors.</p>
<p>Next we need to <strong>&ldquo;map&rdquo;</strong> our window with XMapWindow(&hellip;). Map is weird name for
a function that just shows a window. So basically this could have been named
XShowWindow but it is what it is. After we call it it should opened window.</p>
<p>One last thing that we have to do in this example is to <strong>flush</strong> xlib commands.
Xlib is bufferent commands that we issue. Usually we don&rsquo;t need to call XFlush
because we have a normal event loop but in this simple example we use endless
loop. We need it to run endless so that it won&rsquo;t stop right away.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/linux_creating_x11_windows/image/simple_window.png" alt="800x600 window created with XCreateSimpleWindow"></p>
<p>You can play with window. Change its size, move it around and even close it. But
after you close the window you will have to terminal the program due to our
approach to using endless for loop to keep it open. So just move back to
terminal and press <strong>Ctrl-C</strong> and terminate that process.</p>
<h2 id="02-create-window">02. Create window</h2>
<p>So let&rsquo;s try to create the same window with regular XCreateWindow. It is a bit
more involved but not too much. Here is 02_create_window.c.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>#include &lt;X11/Xlib.h&gt;

int main()
{
    Display* MainDisplay = XOpenDisplay(0);
    Window RootWindow = XDefaultRootWindow(MainDisplay);
    
    int WindowX = 0;
    int WindowY = 0;
    int WindowWidth = 800;
    int WindowHeight = 600;
    int BorderWidth = 0;
    int WindowDepth = CopyFromParent;
    int WindowClass = CopyFromParent;
    Visual* WindowVisual = CopyFromParent;

    int AttributeValueMask = CWBackPixel;
    XSetWindowAttributes WindowAttributes = {};
    WindowAttributes.background_pixel = 0xffafe9af;

    Window MainWindow = XCreateWindow(MainDisplay, RootWindow, 
            WindowX, WindowY, WindowWidth, WindowHeight,
            BorderWidth, WindowDepth, WindowClass, WindowVisual,
            AttributeValueMask, &amp;WindowAttributes);

    XMapWindow(MainDisplay, MainWindow);

    for(;;) {
        XEvent GeneralEvent = {};
        XNextEvent(MainDisplay, &amp;GeneralEvent);
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Compile this code with: <code>gcc 02_create_window.c -o 02_create_window -lX11</code></p>
<p>It looks the same as the previous window but works slightly different. We still
use endless for loop but instead of sleeping we use XNextEvent(&hellip;) to wait for
an event instead of using XFlush(&hellip;). XNextEvent will flush everything so that
we don&rsquo;t have to do it manually.</p>
<p>We use XCreateWindow(&hellip;) instead of XCreateSimpleWindow(&hellip;). This function
requires a bit more parameters and a bit more setup. First of all values are
put into a variables with names for easier readability. It is not required but
just makes code easier to understand.</p>
<p>Comprared to simple version border color and background color are not passed as
parameters. New parameters <strong>&lsquo;border width&rsquo;, &lsquo;window depth&rsquo;, &lsquo;window class&rsquo;,
&lsquo;window visual&rsquo;, &lsquo;attributes values mask&rsquo;, &lsquo;window attributes&rsquo;</strong> are added.</p>
<p>Border width is not important. Window depth is a &ldquo;depth&rdquo; of monitor or how many
bits of information is used for color. We could set it to 24 or just use
CopyFromParent and it will just work. Dont&rsquo; worry about it as it is also not an
important parameter and you can just use defaults.</p>
<p>Window class can either be InputOutput or InputOnly. First one is for when you
want to have a visible window (pretty much every time) and second is for windows
which will never draw. Basically we need only <strong>InputOuput</strong> or you can just
<strong>CopyFromParent</strong> which in our case copy from root window.</p>
<p>Then there is <strong>Visual</strong> that is used for the window. It is opaque data
structure which contains some information about colors and we can juse use
CopyFromParent and safely ignore it (for this case).</p>
<p>The most important part is <strong>&lsquo;window attributes&rsquo;</strong> and a related <strong>&lsquo;attibute
mask&rsquo;</strong>. In the struct of type XSetWindowAttributes we can set different options
related to the window. For example to set window background we passed it as a
separate parater to function. Here we set it in the struct and pass the whole
struct. For optimization purposes X11 uses &lsquo;value mask&rsquo; to know what was passed
in the struct set exactly that. So if you set background color in the struct and
forget to set <strong>CWBackPixel</strong> bit then it won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Here is the list of attributes that could be set in XSetWindowAttributes struct:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pixmap <strong>background_pixmap</strong>;</li>
<li>unsigned long <strong>background_pixel</strong>;</li>
<li>Pixmap <strong>border_pixmap</strong>;</li>
<li>unsigned long <strong>border_pixel</strong>;</li>
<li>int <strong>bit_gravity</strong>;</li>
<li>int <strong>win_gravity</strong>;</li>
<li>int <strong>backing_store</strong>;</li>
<li>unsigned long <strong>backing_planes</strong>;</li>
<li>unsigned long <strong>backing_pixel</strong>;</li>
<li>Bool <strong>save_under</strong>;</li>
<li>long <strong>event_mask</strong>;</li>
<li>long <strong>do_not_propagate_mask</strong>;</li>
<li>Bool <strong>override_redirect</strong>;</li>
<li>Colormap <strong>colormap</strong>;</li>
<li>Cursor <strong>cursor</strong>;</li>
</ul>
<p>and don&rsquo;t forget to set the correspondig bit in the value mask. You can just or
the values together like this: <strong>int AttributeValueMask = CWBackPixel | CWEventMask;</strong></p>
<p>Here is the list of bits values that can be used in the mask: CWBackPixmap,
CWBackPixel, CWBorderPixmap, CWBorderPixel, CWBitGravity, CWWinGravity,
CWBackingStore, CWBackingPlanes, CWBackingPixel, CWOverrideRedirect,
CWSaveUnder, CWEventMask, CWDontPropagate, CWColormap, CWCursor.</p>
<p>As you can see we don&rsquo;t need to set all the fields. Just the one that are
important for our usecase. One of the most important ones is <strong>event_mask</strong>
field. This will be used to filter which events we want to recieve. Currently we
set it up so that none of the events will be available to us. So the very last
of the file where we use XNextEvent(&hellip;) will just get stuck waiting for new
event and will not get any. The good news is that we used XNextEvent(&hellip;) we
don&rsquo;t need to go back to terminal and use Ctrl-C to terminal program as it will
stop working as soon as window manager closes our window.</p>
<h2 id="03-create-windows-with-events">03. Create windows with events</h2>
<p>Here is is 03_create_window_with_events.c</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>#include &lt;X11/Xlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;X11/Xutil.h&gt;

{
    Display* MainDisplay = XOpenDisplay(0);
    Window RootWindow = XDefaultRootWindow(MainDisplay);

        switch(GeneralEvent.type) {
            case KeyPress:
            case KeyRelease:
            {
                XKeyPressedEvent *Event = (XKeyPressedEvent *)&amp;GeneralEvent;
                if(Event-&gt;keycode == XKeysymToKeycode(MainDisplay, XK_Escape))
                {
                    IsWindowOpen = 0;
                }
            } break;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Compile it with: <code>gcc 03_create_window_with_events.c -o 03_create_window_with_events -lX11</code></p>
<p>Here we add one more header file <strong>&lt;X11/Xutil&gt;</strong> in order to have access to key
definitions.</p>
<p>The main that needs to be done first is to add to <strong>event_mask</strong> a list of
events that we want to receive from the server: <strong>StructureNotifyMask,
KeyPressMask, KeyReleaseMask, ExposureMask</strong>. KeyRelease and KeyPress are self
explanatory. StructureNotifyMask will deliver events related to changes in size
and ExporeMask will deliver events related to window needing to be redrawn. For
example when window is first shawn or when part of window was first hidden by
some other window and then shown again. At the same time don&rsquo;t forget to add
<strong>CWEventMask</strong> so that Xorg will know to look into the event_mask attribute;</p>
<p>Now we change our infinite for loop into infinite while loop with condition
<strong>IsWindowOpen</strong> so it will loop until this condition is set to true (or 1 in
our case).</p>
<p>When XNextEvent(&hellip;) recieves event it puts it into variable with type XEvent
which is a general type for all events. Then we can switch over is <strong>.type</strong>
field and know what type of event came to us. In our example we look into
KeyPress and KeyRelease events and when they come we cast it to XKeyPressedEvent
which could be used to extract infromation about which keys have been
pressed/released. Here with the help of XKeysymToKeycode(&hellip;) we convert
XK_Escape value to a keycode and compare it with the data that came from server.
If they match it means that escape key was pressed and we just close the window
by setting IsWindowOpen to false (0) and thus terminating the endless loop.</p>

<p>Here we just create a window a draw a rectangle around with arrow keys [up,
down, left, right]. The only thing that we were required to add was to get a
<strong>Screen</strong> and <strong>GC (Graphics Context)</strong>.  Screen is needed to get graphics
context and graphic context is needed to do drawing some (bad) drawing on the
default window. In this example we use XFillRectangle(&hellip;) to draw that
rectangle. This GC stores information and about how graphics drawing commands
should paint when different paint commands are used. In this example we just
used a default one.</p>
<p>Apart from that in the this example we use &lsquo;client messages&rsquo; in order to cleanly
close window when pressin &lsquo;x&rsquo; button on the window. Window manager is almost a
regular client similar to our window and it does not close our window directly
and rather send our window a special message. We first get an Atom (a special
integer which identifies a string in the server) which is sent to used on window
close from window manager. For this action this atom name is
<strong>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</strong>. It is not required but remove that error message <strong>X
connection to :0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).</strong> which we used to
get in previous examples when closed window.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Even though final version looks like a start of small game development you
definetely should not make your games or apps like this. In the next post I will
write about either software rendering or opengl (or both?) and show a little
more appropriate approach to drawing stuff on the screen.</p>
<p>This post was not about teaching how to use Xlib for app development but rather
show small steps in opening windows and with that build an intuition of how
windows are opened in xlib.</p>
<p>I suggest reading more into parts that are not explaing and playing around with
other function from the documentation. For example I would create a different GC
with different colors, create cirles instead of rectangle and maybe draw some
text. Either way I hope this post was helpful in building some intuition about
basic Xlib.</p>
