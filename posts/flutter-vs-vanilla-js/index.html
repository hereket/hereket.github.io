        <p><strong>tldr:</strong> Compare flutter with js for web dev. Here js wins.</p>
<p>You can play with <strong><a href="/tiny/dna-color-app/">vanila js</a></strong> or with <strong><a href="/tiny/dna-color-app-flutter/">flutter web</a></strong> version.</p>
<p>If you are on mobile and whant to see how they look go to <a href="#video">Vidoeo
section</a></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Flutter is framework to develop apps for android and ios. It is also a pretty
good one. I have been developing apps using flutter for quite some time and it
really helped me to work faster (compared to native development that I used to
do) and my clients save money. For 99% of the projects that I see I recommend
flutter without hesitation as most works required by people that approach could
be easily and efficiently done in flutter.</p>
<p>But I often get questions about using flutter for web as it could simplify
development even more because of web, android and ios could be developed at the
same time. Every single time my answer is &ldquo;If you care about your customers then
don&rsquo;t use flutter&rdquo;. Flutter for small and medium sized projects is not ready for
web. I could say that because I have long experience with web, built quite a few
backends and frontends and have a specific view of how websites should function.
The should be light, user friendly and don&rsquo;t be polite with search engines.
Flutter is not delivering this for the web.</p>
<p>I have created several test web apps with flutter before just to see if anything
has changed and everytime saw that flutter is not ready yet. And even though I
was sure in my reasoning I had little itching that I never did one to one
comparison.</p>
<p>Recently I have been cleaning my computer from old junk and came across a tiny
app I have built in few hours several years ago. It is a super niche app that
helps to color code DNA sequences and manipuate its presentation to assist in
finding patterns and was created to help some scientists automate boring manual
work.</p>
<p>This app is badly written as it was intended to be written in few hours as proof
of concept and later rewritten but it never was. I am saying this just to say
that the code had zero optimizaion, no clear structure and just sloppy. So I
dicided to write similar solution in flutter for web and compare the results. Of
course it is not sientific research but better than nothing.</p>
<p>You might say why vanilla javascript and not some framework like react, vue or
angular and that it would make a better comparision. The answer is simple - I am
lazy. I didn&rsquo;t want to spend much time on and since I already had one version
written in raw javascript then let that be it.</p>
<h2 id="comparison">Comparison</h2>
<p>Here is how they look:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/flutter-vs-vanilla-js/flutter-and-js.png" alt="Flutter and Javascript version of the app"></p>
<p>They are almost identical in functionality and just slightly differ in looks.
For flutter I specifically used only &ldquo;native&rdquo; widgets and I didn&rsquo;t even change
any styles. There is nothing in this build that does not come with flutter when
you install it. Also there are no packages for state management, everything is
don with naive setState(&hellip;) calls. Before you say that this is inefficient
please consider that naive javascript version goes through the same pass, so
comparison is fair.</p>
<h3 id="time-to-develop">Time to develop</h3>
<p>To be hones I didn&rsquo;t measure timing for both of these because I didn&rsquo;t care at
the time of the development. From what I recall, javascript took several hours.
I dod&rsquo;t remember how much exactly but definetly more than five and less that 20.
For flutter version it also took several hours but I didn&rsquo;t develop it in one
go. During working on flutter version I had some time with family, spent some
time arguing with somebody wrong on the internet, went shopping and had dinner.
So it took definetly more that 2.5 hours and less that 8 hours.</p>
<p>If just comparing my feeling flutter version felt like way more faster than js
version. But keep in mind that when I was building flutter version I already
knew how everything should work and flutter is a framework which has prebuilt
components.</p>
<h3 id="development-experience">Development experience</h3>
<p>Even though I do a lot of flutter development for mobile and like it, developing
for web is horrible. I have good enough machine to handle different workload but
with android-studio having a code and chrome rendering output it is the first
time that my machine actually froze.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/flutter-vs-vanilla-js/freeze.png" alt="Flutter web dev ate all memroy"></p>
<p>You might say that I need to enable swap but I turned swap off specifically to
know when I rich my <strong>32 Gb</strong> memory limit and I never did in a year since I bought
this computer. For comparison I run Macintosh and Windows in qemu at the same
time, run all types of android developement and quite a few other stuff. I guess
if I ever decide to create flutter web apps I will need to upgrade to <strong>64 Gb</strong>.</p>
<p>Javascript version was created on some 10 years old with <strong>8 Gb</strong> of memory, vim and
chrome with zero lag (at least that is how I remember it).</p>
<h3 id="size">Size</h3>
<p>Javascript version when everything is combined weighs <strong>48 Kb</strong>. There are only
3 files: styles.css, index.html and dna.js.</p>
<p>Flutter version if you go to build/web directory and measure all the files
weighs <strong>19.8 Mb</strong>. When I ran <strong>&lsquo;find . -type f | wc -l&rsquo;</strong> in that directory it
showed 27 files. All this was created by <strong>&lsquo;flutter build web&rsquo;</strong> command. Here is
what ncdu thinks about it:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/flutter-vs-vanilla-js/flutter-web-ncdu.png" alt="Flutter web dev ate all memroy"></p>
<h3 id="site-speed">Site speed</h3>
<p><strong>Vanilla</strong></p>
<p><img src="/posts/flutter-vs-vanilla-js/sitespeed-vanilla.png" alt="Flutter web dev ate all memory"></p>
<p>I think it is pretty expected for this to be fast due to small sizes and few
files.</p>
<h3 id="ux">UX</h3>
<p>As for UX it is hard to say as it is could be unique for each individual but
from my perspective using flutter version felt worse. It was slower, rendering
of text was bad for my eyes, it felt sluggish at times and in general felt a bit
off.</p>
<h3 id="memory">Memory</h3>
<p>Javascript tab: <strong>37_984 Kb</strong> of memory</p>
<p>Flutter version varied a lot depending on being idle for some time or being
used few seconds ago. The lowest I have seen was about <strong>400_000 Kb</strong> and as
much as <strong>900_000 Kb</strong>;</p>
<p><img src="/posts/flutter-vs-vanilla-js/flutter-tab-memory.png" alt="Flutter tab memory"></p>
<h3 id="rendering-speed">Rendering speed.</h3>
<p>If you played with it a bit you probably have see that vanilla version is way
faster that flutter version. They both are unoptimized (I did tiny optimization
to move creating some objects out of loops but not more that that). For flutter
if you turn off rendering text it becomes significantly faster. It is due to
creation of TextSpan, then TextPainter, then layouting and finaly painting it on
canvas. Maybe there is a way to do that out of loop but this is how I knew it is
done and didn&rsquo;t spend any time reasearching how to do it faster. Javascript
version does not have this issues as it renders text directly.</p>
<p><strong>Flutter web</strong></p>
<p><img src="/posts/flutter-vs-vanilla-js/sitespeed-flutter.png" alt="Flutter web dev ate all memroy"></p>
<p>This one surprezed me a little as I think that 60 is too generous. In my
opinion is should be around 40 but I guess due to me loading some static content
before flutter starts loading it got good <strong>FCP</strong> and <strong>LCP</strong> scores and it tricked
the system a bit.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>First of all I want to mention that flutter is awsome tool for android and ios
development. The team did a great job and it gave a lot of pleasure to create
some interesting projects with it.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s be fair and accept that at the current state flutter is not suited for
web apps that are small to medium sizes. I cannot say anything about big
projects as the overhead discussed above might be tiny compared to benefits it
would bring over othet stuff.</p>
<p>I wrote the first to check my feelings and compare with some real numbers. Also
this will be an easy answer to people who never tried flutter for web and ask
why it is not ready yet for production.</p>
<p>Flutter code is horrible and I din&rsquo;t put it anywhere online for beginner to copy
and learn from it but if you want it and email me, then I will send you a zip file.</p>
