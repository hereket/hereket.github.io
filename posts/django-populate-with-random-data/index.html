        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>One of the best features of Django is the speed it provides to develop fast
prototypes. It does not mean that it is a framework to develop prototypes but it
is very helpful for building quick and fast prototypes when you need one. It is
my first when I need to build a proof of concept for something or when I want
quickly prepare something for a presentation. Yet one feature that I was always
missing is the ability to quickly populate datatabase with some random (or real)
data just to see how it all fits together while you are just shaping your ideas.</p>
<p>You might argue that django has <strong>fixtures</strong> and it is a solution to this
problem but I find fixtures to be a bit to cumbersome and it becomes a chore to
maintain consistency when you change your models quickly. I wanted something
that allowed me to load data programmatically where I could create data on the
fly like calculating different types of pricing, creating users, creating images
and adding them to db and just plain old load testing by creating a lot of data.</p>
<p>I have been using this approach for a few years now and recently when I was
working with a team which was waiting long time for the data to be provided. And
when I adviced them to just fill the data randomly (for now) to see how it all
fits together they were suprised that this was an option. I hope this will help
some people to who have not tried this approach before.</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>There are different ways that structuring this could be approached but my
preffered way is store all the files in a <code>'__generator'</code> directory inside the
root project. I mark all non esential folders that could be easily deleted
without affecting the project with double underscores. This way it stands out
from the rest of the apps and I always know that I can easily delete all such
folder. This is a place where all dirty code and unsafe practices are allowed
and <strong>MUST be deleted</strong> before project goes into initial production release.
This code is unsafe and never be used with production or preproduction code.</p>
<p>Inside the __generator folder I usually create <strong>&lsquo;images&rsquo;</strong> and <strong>&lsquo;data&rsquo;</strong>
folders. Images folder is used as a pool of images to load during each cycle and
data is mostly used to store text files and excel files that store real
information to load. Then I add a &lsquo;scratch.sh&rsquo; bash script to load the scripts
and usually one py file per app or per task. I used a bash file because I was
not building a system. The main goal was to automate some small tasks and at the
time it was a good solution to run couple of commands and it never grew out of
it. You could easily build use a python script with all the good practices but
then it again becomes a chore instead of a quick and small system. Also it is
very beginner friendly.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>mkdir -p __generator/{data,images}
</code></pre><h2 id="python-scripts">Python scripts</h2>
<p>Each python script is just a simple file that does all the data loading for a specific
model or an app. Unfortunately you cannot just a load your models from created
django apps as it won&rsquo;t work. The scripts need a small setup that will allow to
call django and your apps directly. I use this header in each file and even
though it is not DRY and found it to be more appropriate for quick scripts like
these. Here is how header looks like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>import os
import sys
import django

current_file = os.path.realpath(__file__)
base_path = os.path.dirname(current_file)
project_main_path = os.path.realpath(base_path + &#39;/../&#39;)


sys.path.append(project_main_path)
os.environ.setdefault(&#39;DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE&#39;, &#39;project_main.settings&#39;)
django.setup()
</code></pre><p>After you have added this header you can write your regular django code as if
this file was regular view file with only difference is that it will be called
directly. For example let add users to our system. After the header part add
code similar to this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model

User = get_user_model()

user = User(
    is_staff=True,
    is_superuser=True,
    username=&#39;alfred&#39;, 
    phone=&#39;123123123&#39;, 
    name = &#39;Alfred&#39;,
    email = &#39;alfred@test.com&#39;,
    lastname = &#39;Salahov&#39;,
    address = &#39;Sezame Street 42&#39;,
)
user.set_password(&#39;Sdio89sDKwopkkj&#39;)
user.save()


for index in range(100):
    user = User(
        is_staff=False,
        is_superuser=False,
        username=&#39;user{}&#39;.format(index), 
        phone=&#39;123999{:03d}&#39;.format(index), 
        name = &#39;John{}&#39;.format(index),
        email = &#39;jonh{}@example.com&#39;.format(index),
        lastname = &#39;Smith{}&#39;.format(index),
        address = &#39;Backe Street {}&#39;.format(index),
    )
    user.set_password(&#39;abcXYZhome{}&#39;.format(index))
    user.save()
</code></pre><p>This approach could be done to any app or model within the app and even if you
need to do some complex logic that loads different models from different apps
that generate data based on each other. Now you are on the land of programming
and can do pretty much anything. Load data from your google drive, from an API,
get data from local excel file or any file format that you work with.</p>
<p>Now you can just launch this script with regular</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>python users.py
</code></pre><p>from within the __generator directory. Just make sure you source environment so
that the script know about django.</p>
<h2 id="bash-script-automation">Bash script automation</h2>
<p>The next step in automation of boring task is using a bash script so that you
won&rsquo;t be launching the same tasks again and again. I want to repeat that if you
want you can easily ditch bash scripting and just do all this from python but
for me specifically it is more comfortable to launch these tasks from bash
script. Here is a version of the script:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>pushd ../

find . -path &#34;*/migrations/*.py&#34; -not -name &#34;__init__.py&#34; -delete
find . -path &#34;*/migrations/*.pyc&#34;  -delete

rm db.sqlite3
./manage.py makemigrations
./manage.py migrate
popd

pushd ../../media
rm -r *
popd

python users.py
# python products.py
python products_random.py
python pages.py
python banners.py
python product_collection.py
python configurations.py
</code></pre><p>First of all since we are inside &lsquo;__generator&rsquo; directory I go up one directory
to be inside the root directory of the project. From here I first delete all
migrations, remove the database (remember I told you not use it with anything
production related?) and recreate them from scratch. The reason I do this is
because I do a lot of crazy changed to the models that would sometimes break
migrations and used to require me spend some time thinking about how bring the
app migrations to consistent state. And this is something that I don&rsquo;t want to
spend time on when I am just exploring.</p>
<p>Then I go to my <strong>media</strong> folder that lives outside of root directory to remove
all the media files. It is because each each script invocation creates random
data which will be obsolete on the next rerun and since I run this script quite
often it would quickly fill my drive otherwise.</p>
<p>After that I just run all the the scripts that generate data. Most of the data
is random but in this script I showed that somethimes I get real data that was
stored for example in excel file. So I could quickly switch between random and
real data exploration.</p>
<h2 id="video">Video</h2>
<p>Here is a short video I created for my friends to illustrate how I use it. It
uses slightly different scripts as I separated them by real and fake data. Fake
data is smaller in product count but takes more time to generate because it uses
quite a few images per product and generate some images for product specific
filters. Real data does not have those and thus works a bit faster</p>

<h2 id="clearing-postgresql">Clearing Postgresql</h2>
<p>Sometimes limitations of sqlite does not allow to use it for even in debug
versions of your app because your app might use features of SQL that are not
supported by it, for example esasy searching for data over multple tables with
could contain data in in different languages. In those case you have to use
something other that sqlite. If you also use postgresql for your experiment
project you could substitute remove sqlite database with these script if you use
postgesql:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo systemctl restart postgresql

DB_NAME=&#34;some_database_name&#34;
DB_USER=&#34;some_db_user&#34;
DB_PASS=&#34;1231))(*)S(Df3&#34;

sudo -u postgres psql -U postgres  -c &#34;drop database $DB_NAME;&#34;
sudo -u postgres psql -U postgres  -c &#34;drop user $DB_USER;&#34;
sudo -u postgres psql -U postgres  -c &#34;create user $DB_USER;&#34;
sudo -u postgres psql -U postgres  -c &#34;create database $DB_NAME;&#34;
sudo -u postgres psql -U postgres  -c &#34;alter role $DB_NAME with password $DB_PASS;&#34;
sudo -u postgres psql -U postgres  -c &#34;grant all privileges on database $DB_NAME to $DB_USER;&#34;
sudo -u postgres psql -U postgres  -c &#34;alter database $DB_NAME owner to $DB_USER;&#34;
</code></pre><p>** PLEASE DON&rsquo;T USE** this on production setups as you will most definitely lose
your valuable data and I will not take any responsibility for that. You have
been warned!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The programmatic approach to adding data to you django application is a lot of
fun and speeds up the development quite a bit. If you still not using something
like this for your testing and explorations you definetely should at least try
once to see if you like it.</p>
<p>I think everything that I wrote should be simple and self expanatory but if you
still could make it work just email me and will upload to github a simplified
working version to github to play around.</p>
