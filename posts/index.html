    <p>TLDR: There is a video at the bottom that showcases this method if you don&rsquo;t want to read: watch video
Intro Normal IDE show errors at the time when you are typing. I don&rsquo;t really like especially for static pages since compiler can do find all the stupid syntax errors. I don&rsquo;t like them because it is the same as writing in prose in MS Word. It always annoys you with not important errors like misspellings, comma and other stuff that is not integral part of the story.</p>

    <p>watch video
There are multiple approaches to development and everyone has a some style of how they like to approach this process. Every task requires could require totally different approach and different IDE. So if I do native Android or Flutter developemnt it is natural for me to Android Stuio, for Java code it is Intellij, for Qt it is more comforatable if Qt Creator is used.
Here I use pharase &ldquo;quasi IDE&rdquo; to separate from trandional understanding of an IDE.</p>

<h3><a class="title" href="/posts/todo_note_management/">Easy todo and notes management with VIM, dmenu and bash</a></h3>

<a class="summary" href="/posts/todo_note_management/">
    <p>I have been taking notes and managing my todo lists for quite some time. During this time I have used different tools for both. For note taking I tried evernote, google docs, obsidian, OneNote, regular files and quite a few others. The same goes for todo lists. I probably used everything from top 20 list for apps for todo management (even taskwarrior). But in the end I ended up using just neovim, dmenu and a little bit of shell magic.</p>

<h3><a class="title" href="/posts/instant_code_reload/">Instant code reload in Android</a></h3>

<time datetime="2023-07-21">Jul 21, 2023</time>


<a class="summary" href="/posts/instant_code_reload/">
    <p>Introduction Here I am presenting one possible way to do &ldquo;on the fly code reloading&rdquo; of JNI code. The whole code is C/C++ compiled in 2 shared libraries and realoded on demand without restaring the application.
This example uses a game tiny &ldquo;game&rdquo; where you just walk around space. This is just a placeholder idea borrowed from Casey Muratori&rsquo;s Handmade Hero youtube series.
The build process used in this project is described in: Build android apk from command line without gradle post.</p>

<a class="summary" href="/posts/android_from_command_line/">
    <p>Introduction This is post is similar to the one about building flutter but a bit different. Actually this one was writter a few years prior to writing flutter version but just never got published. Since then some steps has changed and I moved to Java 11. But you if you still build with java 8 old build method is still surprisingly functional.
So the idea is to build and APK file which then can be installed on an android phone without using gradle and doing each step &ldquo;manually&rdquo;.</p>

<a class="summary" href="/posts/flutter_without_gradle/">
    <p>Initial draft
Introduction Flutter is a very useful framework which does quite a lot of heavy lifting and hides all the dirty details inside a black box. It is very good when you want get the job done but I really like opening black boxes as I really don&rsquo;t like magic.
The sole reasoning behind this project is to build a &lsquo;hello world&rsquo; project with as few steps as possible and in the end build an apk file which could be installed on an android phone.</p>

<time datetime="2023-07-06">Jul 6, 2023</time>


<a class="summary" href="/posts/web_analytics_effects/">
    <p>What happened? So I create this site to test some ideas this time I chose to use a &lsquo;static site&rsquo; approach. There is no specific reason why I chose it to be this way it is just I wanted to try something that I have not tried before. My last test was with django.
So one of my first experiments I wanted to do is to stack different web analytics tool on the page and see how they behave and report data for later comparison.</p>

    <p>Start Hello. Initial post in this site. Currently the plan is to use it to test diffent technologies, write some thoughts and share some hobby projects. At the same time I am planning to practice my writing skills.
My plan is to publish a lot of raw content without deep work on it but we will see how it turns out to be.</p>
