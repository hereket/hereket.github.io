        <p>This is partly a continuation of previous article on this topic:
<a href="/posts/exploring-xorg-connections/">Exploring Xorg connections</a></p>
<p>While exploring Xorg and its connections I stumbled upong interesting fact that
some apps open multiple connections to Xorg even though they have just one
window. For example chromium had 7, skype 8, firefox and telegram had each 2
connections. Since Skype connection count was suspisiously close to chromeium
I immediately assumed that it is all because of <strong>Electron</strong> since it is based
on chromium. Once I opened vscode and indeed it had 8 connections which leads to
assumption that all chromium based (electron) applications open 7+ Xorg
connections.</p>
<p>This got me interested in getting to know what those 7 connections were. Since
chromium had 7 connections and the rest of chromium based apps were 8 connections
I thought that chromium opens 7 connections and all others just open one extra for
themself. This lead me to look into chromium as it was common factor between all
of them.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/monitoring-raw-x11-communication/chromium-connections.png" alt="All connections from Chromium to
Xorg"></p>
<p>Initially it looked like chromium used one connection either for each window or
for each tab. But later experiments showed that no matther amount of chromium
windows or tabs open, number of connections is remained exactly 7. This leads to
a different assumption that Chromium might split connection by functionality.
But how to verify it? I first started with grepping chromium source code as I
thought it was the easiest way but after 30-50 minutes it looked that the source
code would take more time to figure out than to just reverse it by looking at
the protocol communication level.</p>
<p>To my big surprise unix sockets are not supported neither by <strong>tcpdump</strong> nor by
<strong>wireshark</strong>. This totally broke my feeling that I can easily just plug some
ready made tool, enter my root password and have full access to the information.
After some time of googling and then &ldquo;talking&rdquo; to various chatbots I still
didn&rsquo;t find an easy way. But then I remembered that X11 is client-server model
and must support TCP (something that I am more comfortable with) and it still
does.</p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: <strong>If you decide to turn on TCP communication on yoru Xorg server,
I do not take any responsibility and fully discourage doing so unless you know
what you are doing.</strong></p>
<p>To force X server to work through TCP we need to change how it starts. On my
system there is a file responsible for starting X located at
<strong>/etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc</strong>. In that file you need to ask X server not to
listen on <strong>unix</strong> and <strong>local</strong> connections. And since <strong>tcp</strong> connections are
probably disable by default you need to ask X to enable it (without it won&rsquo;t
start). So for myself I put this line in my xserverrc:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>exec /usr/bin/X -nolisten unix -nolisten local -listen tcp &#34;$@&#34;
</code></pre><p>To make it work just reboot the system or kill the X server just dont&rsquo; forget to
save all data before doing so.</p>
<p>After start X server again you can list all connections and grep for &ldquo;x11&rdquo; or
&ldquo;6000&rdquo;. In my current configuration <strong>ss</strong> shows port 6000 as x11 when it lists
all connections. This is how it might look like:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/monitoring-raw-x11-communication/x11-tcp-connections.png" alt="X11 TCP connectino list"></p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t read previous post here is how Xorg connections look like
normally (on my computer they are always abstract unix sockets):</p>
<p><img src="/posts/monitoring-raw-x11-communication/x11-unix-connections.png" alt="X11 TCP connectino list"></p>
<p>So now as we forced everybody to work over TCP we can wireshark to monitor
communication between clients and server. Just boot up wireshark and ask it to
monitor everything on <strong>Loopback</strong> interface. This will create a lot of logs so
my advice is just log enough interactions with the system and then save it to a
local file and work with &ldquo;offline&rdquo; version. I did the same and recorded just
over 1 minute of interaction with chromium where I first start monitoring then
opened Chromium  and did several operations like opening and closing windows,
opening and closing tabs, copy pasting and the then closed Chromium all
together. This is how it looked:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/monitoring-raw-x11-communication/wireshark.png" alt="Wireshark session"></p>
<p>At then end 72 secons of wireshark session ended up as one file of 740 Mb of
pcap data which consist of 120890 packets. The is big bowl of data points which
needs to be filtered to be of any use. First I filtered out anything that is not
related to X11 protocol by using <strong>x11</strong> filter in the display filter bar. This
alone reduced sample size to 78960 packets and removed 34% of TCP overhead and
other unrelated data.</p>
<p>So next is just filter by each connection and see what happened in each one. The
trick is similar to what has been done in previous post. Filter all connections
that has <strong>x11</strong> or <strong>6000</strong> port as a destination port. It is a lot simpler
than previous script (but I was lazy and used old script and change some params
there even though it is less efficient). This is what I got when I run the
script on my machine.</p>

</code></pre><p>The first column give just an <strong>index</strong> in the list of results. Second column is
<strong>source port</strong> and fourth is <strong>process ID</strong>. So started chromium window has 2
processes one of which has two connections and the other has four connections
with Xorg. In order to explore communication or each connection then we just
need to filter by x11 protocol and specific port like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>x11 &amp;&amp; tcp.port == 37008
</code></pre><p>In total my interactions with chromium created 65747 packets which is slighly more
than half of all the X11 packets captured. I didn&rsquo;t measure but I guess second
largest traffic user could be wireshark itself. If we filter just Chromium in 72
seconds it gives us almost 7.5 Megabytes of X11 only traffic which give us
on average 105 Kbs X11 traffic.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>port 37008 | 341 packets   | 79754 bytes
port 37002 | 19145 packets | 3459550 bytes
port 37050 | 45670 packets | 4130920 bytes
port 37022 | 14 packets    | 15920 bytes
port 37030 | 252 packets   | 62120 bytes
port 37062 | 14 packets    | 15920 bytes
port 37036 | 38 packets    | 23908 bytes
-----------------------------------------------------
sum:       | 65747 bytes   | 7788092 bytes, 7.42 Mb
</code></pre><p>From the stats above we can see that there is some heavy lifting from one of the
port of each of the 2 processes. It could be hat port 37002 is doing input
processing and port 37050 is responsible for all drawing operations.</p>
<p>From one of my interactive sessions where I run wireshark and monitored each
port for activity when I did something with window I had these notes on packet
chagnes.</p>
<ul>
<li>port 1: Nothing - Map notify and Atoms setup</li>
<li>port 2: Keyboard input. More packets on input</li>
<li>port 3: Window attribute changes</li>
<li>port 4: Nothing</li>
<li>port 5: Constantly sends something when window is visible and nothing when
invisible.</li>
<li>port 6: Nothing</li>
<li>port 7: Nothing</li>
</ul>
<p>From the capture above port <strong>37008</strong> just sets InternAtoms, queries for some
extensions and recieves some notifications such as PropertyNotify and
xkb-MapNotify. Here is the list of requested Atoms:</p>

</code></pre><p>The port <strong>37050</strong> is the one related to drawing. It queried some extensions and
then mostly worked with GLX and DRI2, requested GetGeometry,
XFree-VidModeExtension, GetInputFocus and recived events such as
dri2-InvalidateBuffers.</p>
<p>Port <strong>37022</strong> didn&rsquo;t do anything of value. From the log it is visible that it
initialized at the beginning and didn&rsquo;t do anything for the rest of interaction.
It so small that I could list all of its interactions in one image:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/monitoring-raw-x11-communication/chrome-port-37022-interaction.png" alt="Chromium port 37022 port interaction"></p>
<p>Port <strong>37030</strong> was a bit more involved than previous one. For some reason it
started with request of the same atoms as in port 37002 request. Maybe port port
37002 from first process setup the Atoms and filled with data for second process
to read it? Apart from this it just tried some GetProperty and QueryTree.</p>
<p>Port <strong>37062</strong> is pretty has as few actions as port 37002. Did a setup at the
begining and nothing else.</p>
<p>Port <strong>37036</strong> is also a &ldquo;passive&rdquo; connection which queries for some extensions
and then does nothing. It looks like it queries extensions that were already
queried by previous connections.</p>
<p>From what I have seen so far I do not see anything that would require having
separate connections. It might be some optimization techniques which I don&rsquo;t
know about. It would have been good if someone wrote a reasoning behind this
structure. (I searched online but either I am bad at searching or it just not
there yet).</p>
<h3 id="what-about-firefox">What about Firefox?</h3>
<p>I did the same but shorter exploration with firexox. It uses one process and <strong>two</strong>
connections to connection to Xorg. First connection seems to be realated
specifically related to input and everything related to window management and
second used for drawing only. In the port related to input it setups Atoms
related to window management like WM_DELETE_WINDOW, WM_LOCALE_NAME, WM_PROTOCOLS
and etc. Apart from this there were nothing out of ordinary.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-connections-other-applications-open">How much connections other applications open</h3>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t do deep exploration for other applications but here is some short
information about apps that I use almost every day.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>vlc - 2 connections
gpicview - 1 connection
skype - 8 connections spread between 2 processes (3 + 5)
telegram-desktop - 2 connections
inkscape - 1 connection
gimp - 1 connection
lowriter (soffice.bin) - 1 connection
localc (soffice.bin) - 1 connection
st (terminal) - 1 connection
android-studio (java) - 2 connections 1 process
vscode - 8 connections, 2 processes. (3 connections for &#39;code-oss&#39;, 5 connections
for &#39;electron&#39; named processes)
</code></pre><p>For Chromium and Firefox amount of opened windows and tabs does not affect number
of connections they always remain static. For for simpler apps like for exampel
<strong>st (terminal)</strong> it opens new process and new connection for each of its
windows.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I got involved with this crazy but super fun idea by accidentally stumbling upon
that closing skype closed a bunch of Xorg connections. Which made me interested
in finding why skype needs so much connections in the first place. This lead to
understanding that it was chromium who was responsible for openning all this
connections and skype was just using it.</p>
<p>I looked at how to force Xorg to allow only TCP connections so that look at its
traffic through wireshark (don&rsquo;t forget to turn it off) and then analyze what
chromium was doing with all those connections. From very surface exploration
without digging into details and looking into chromiums source code it looks
like it just some kind of optimization technique. There is one connection for
drawing and one for input.</p>
<p>This post does not open something new. Chromium source code is open and you can
find this by reading the code. But this is just a diffrenet way to look at it
and was fun way to waste my time. I hope you had your fun looking at it and
didn&rsquo;t waste yours.</p>
