        <p><strong>TLDR</strong>: Instagram changes their TLS certificates daily and they use
certificates that are just about to expire in a week.</p>
<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p>Since I occasionally help debug issues with office networks, I have
built a simple cross-platform app for myself. One part of the app is a tool that gets the site
certificate and displays various needed information. To test edge cases and
verify that it works as needed I was testing it with different sites and
different certificates. While that testing I stumbled upon a strange anomaly
that I have never seen before. A certificate for Instagram was issued for 53 days.
Usually, I expect a certificate to be issued for 90, 180, 365, or close to those
values and this seemed very odd.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/instagram-single-day-certificates/network-tools-example.png" alt="Network tool example screen"></p>
<p>Apart from that certificate has about a week left to expire and I thought I
would come in a few days to see how many days of buffer Instagram uses to trigger
certificate update. But a few days later when I came back it still showed a
certificate that had 8 days to expire. After a week it still had 8 days to
expire.</p>
<p>So this led me to a hypothesis that Instagram changes its certificate once a
week and they use certificates that are about to expire to reduce certificate
lifetime. At the time I was a bit busy and couldn&rsquo;t exactly verify that apart
from checking certificate lifetime once in a while. I returned to it after
server weeks.</p>
<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<p>After I got a little more time to test my hypothesis I allocated a separate
machine for testing and wrote a little script to download a certificate from
Instagram, extract the needed information from it, and store it on the disk for later
analysis if needed. The certificate was saved in a custom format with extracted
information and the certificate itself was stored in it. The name of the file was just a
<strong>sha1 hash</strong> of the certificate and this name was later used to check if
the certificate has changed.</p>
<p>Script downloaded certificate, got its sha1, and checked if there is already a
file with that hash in the data directory. If the file is missing then it will
do certificate processing to extract some information and store it in a file with
a new hash, extract information, and the certificate itself. Then the script slept for
<strong>5 minutes</strong> and repeated the process. 5 minutes is an arbitrary delta that
gives a 10-minute window for when the certificate changed. The task was not
to know the exact minute and second timing of certificate change and a single
request once in 5 minutes is polite enough to not cause any trouble.</p>
<p>The final stored result of the certificate and extracted data looks something like this:</p>

</code></pre><h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>Apart from the allocated machine rebooting once or twice the test went surprisingly very well
compared to the little time I spent on writing and setting things up. In total, it collected 20 certificates per domain. There were 1 or 2 days that I
missed due to a machine reboot. But if we don&rsquo;t consider those days then it is
clear that Instagram changes certificates <strong>daily</strong> and rarely <strong>twice a
day</strong>.</p>
<p>In general, Instagram starts using a certificate that has a lifetime of slightly
more than 8 days and replaces it one day later when it has left a little more than 7
days before expiration. We can assume that they use &ldquo;1 certificate per day&rdquo;.
Apart from that <strong>&lsquo;instagram.com&rsquo;</strong> and <strong>&lsquo;<a href="https://www.instagram.com">www.instagram.com</a>&rsquo;</strong> use different
certificates even though the certificate for instagram.com could sign www
subdomain because it uses a wildcard certificate.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look a collected certificates in general.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/instagram-single-day-certificates/valid_from.png" alt="Valid from for instagram">
<img src="/posts/instagram-single-day-certificates/valid_until.png" alt="Valid until for instagram">
<img src="/posts/instagram-single-day-certificates/current_time_date.png" alt="Approximate time when cert change ocurred"></p>
<p>Above we have 3 graphs for each certificate valid_from, valid_until, and the
<strong>approximate time</strong> for when the certificate was swapped. Apart from a couple of anomalies
(due to machine reboots), we can see that certificates are changed daily.
Certificate validity start and end times are increasing by a single day. The
only unusual thing here is that for &ldquo;instagram.com&rdquo; the first 3 certificates had the
same &ldquo;valid_from&rdquo; field. Which might indicate that I accidentally stumbled upon
Instagram is changing its certificate time allocation range. Remember initially I
came across when the total time for the certificate was 53 days. It could be that they
used to get certificates with the same starting day but different ending days
which could have resulted in odd date ranges for the certificate.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/instagram-single-day-certificates/current_time_hours.png" alt="Certificate change time hour">
<img src="/posts/instagram-single-day-certificates/current_time_minutes.png" alt="Certificate change time minute"></p>
<p>From the above graphs, we can see that certs are changed somewhere between 16:00
and 17:00 in UTC. When we look into the minutes graph it happens somewhere
around 25-30 minutes. Since checking for certificates happens once every 5
minutes we have a &ldquo;radius&rdquo; of 5 minutes around each minute datapoint. But also
since it was a machine with a weak wifi connection it could be that the internet
might not have always been available and that could have added a bit more jitter
to the data.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/instagram-single-day-certificates/days_left_current.png" alt="Days left of current certificate">
<img src="/posts/instagram-single-day-certificates/days_left_prev.png" alt="Days left of previous certificate"></p>
<p>For these two graphs we have a measurement of how much time left for the
certificate to expire at the time when we queried it. First graph show how much
time left for current active certificate and second graph shows how much time
left for the previous one. As we can clearly see (if we remove outliers) that
when a certificate is introduced it has about 8 days left for it to expire and
removed certificate still had 7 days.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>In this short period of about a month it was clear that instagram changes it&rsquo;s
certificates on daily basis. It&rsquo;s main domain &lsquo;instagram.com&rsquo; and subdomain
&lsquo;<a href="https://www.instagram.com">www.instagram.com</a>&rsquo; each get separate certificates even though main domain has
wildcard certificate and could could secure it&rsquo;s subdomains. Changing
certificates daily could be an attempt from instagram reduce &ldquo;certificate life&rdquo;
to just one day instead of currently used mininum of about 90 days. It is hard
for me to agree that it actually improves performance as the main attack vector
of stealing private keys is still there if they are stored in close proximity
and when somebody gets access to one they probably would have gotten access to
all of them. But maybe they have some clever mechanism on the backend which
stores them separately or somehow rotates access to them for the group of
different people.</p>
