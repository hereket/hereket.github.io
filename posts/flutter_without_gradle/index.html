        <p>Initial draft</p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Flutter is a very useful framework which does quite a lot of heavy lifting and
hides all the dirty details inside a black box. It is very good when you want
get the job done but I really like opening black boxes as I really don&rsquo;t like
magic.</p>
<p>The sole reasoning behind this project is to build a &lsquo;hello world&rsquo; project with
as few steps as possible and in the end build an apk file which could be
installed on an android phone. This will be a good starting point for other
people to start investigating the build process, involved files and required
tools. I will be using <strong>linux</strong> (archlinux) and build only an <strong>apk</strong> and won&rsquo;t
cover anything related to build steps on and for other platforms. Also current
plan is to do only <strong>debug</strong> build and ignore release build but I might add
release version later.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: You should not use this way to build your apps. Even for you
hobby projects. It will be slower, more error prone and just in general
degrading experience.</p>
<h3 id="refresher">Refresher</h3>
<p>So the simplest way to create and build a flutter application involves these
steps:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>flutter create app1
cd app1
flutter build apk --debug
</code></pre><p>In this article I will try to replicate process done in those commands with an additonal step
of installing resulting apk on a device. Actually all most of the time is spent
in the last command. So in reality I will be doing the last step and you will
see some of the tasks being done in this one line.</p>
<h3 id="start">Start</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with actually building a flutter/dart &lsquo;application&rsquo; not tied to any
specific platform. Since we are starting from scratch let&rsquo;s start with creating a
folder to contain all of our apps files. I will call it <strong>&lsquo;handmade_flutter_app&rsquo;</strong>. This
will be our <strong>ROOT_FOLDER</strong>. Inside ROOT_FOLDER let&rsquo;s create &lsquo;__build&rsquo; and &lsquo;flutter&rsquo; folders.
Inside &lsquo;flutter&rsquo; directory we need &rsquo;lib&rsquo; directory and pubspec.yaml file and inside &rsquo;lib&rsquo; directory
let&rsquo;s create &lsquo;main.dart&rsquo; file.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>handmade_flutter_app
    __build
    flutter
        pubspec.yaml
        lib
            main.dart
</code></pre><p>pubspec.yaml file</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>name: handmade_flutter

}

  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override

    return MaterialApp(
      title: &#39;Flutter Demo&#39;,
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
        useMaterial3: true,
      ),
      home: const MyHomePage(title: &#39;Flutter Demo Home Page&#39;),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyHomePage({super.key, required this.title});

  final String title;

  @override
  State&lt;MyHomePage&gt; createState() =&gt; _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State&lt;MyHomePage&gt; {
  int _counter = 0;

  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        backgroundColor: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.inversePrimary,
        title: Text(widget.title),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: &lt;Widget&gt;[
            const Text(
              &#39;You have pushed the button this many times:&#39;,
            ),
            Text(
              &#39;$_counter&#39;,
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineMedium,
            ),

        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _incrementCounter,
        tooltip: &#39;Increment&#39;,
        child: const Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Actually it for a &lsquo;hello world&rsquo; I could have used smaller files for pubspec and
main.dart but I chose to use exactly the same files that is used in a general
flutter app that is created by &lsquo;flutter create app&rsquo; command. This is done just
as an arbitrary minimum bar for my definition of proof of concept &lsquo;hello world&rsquo;.</p>
<p>These files are enough for us to start building the project. So the first step
to build the project is to <strong>&lsquo;get packages&rsquo;</strong>. This is similar to &lsquo;flutter pub
get&rsquo; but I will not be using flutter for it. So from within the &lsquo;flutter&rsquo;
directory run this command:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>dart pub get
</code></pre><p>Actually real flutter will run this program with more options but this good
enough for us.</p>
<p>After this command there will be 2 new files created: &lsquo;pubspec.lock&rsquo; and
&lsquo;.dart_tool/package_config.json&rsquo;. We run this program to download all required
dependencies and to create package_config.json which is used by in the next
step.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>dart \
    --disable-dart-dev \
    --packages=/opt/flutter/packages/flutter_tools/.dart_tool/package_config.json \
    /opt/flutter/bin/cache/flutter_tools.snapshot \
    --quiet \
    assemble \
    --no-version-check \
    --output ../__build/assets \
    -dTargetFile=lib/main.dart \
    -dTargetPlatform=android \
    -dBuildMode=debug \
    -dTrackWidgetCreation=true \
    debug_android_application \
</code></pre><p>And we are done!</p>
<p>Not really, as there are quite a lot of glue missing but this is indeed the was
the step that was single most important step to create a flutter application.
After it we will have all required &lsquo;flutter&rsquo; files created and ready to be
packed inside the app. They all will be placed in <strong>&rsquo;__build/assets/flutter_assets&rsquo;</strong> folder.
It will contain everything needed for the &lsquo;flutter app&rsquo; to run and I don&rsquo;t want
to go into depth what those files are but it will contain compiled dart code
with required assets.</p>
<p>In the command above there is &lsquo;flutter_tools.snapshot&rsquo; compiled file from the
installation location of your flutter sdk. If you want to do some &lsquo;print
debugging or just to play around by changing source code you can change
&lsquo;<strong>&lt;YOUR_FLUTTER_ROOT&gt;</strong>/bin/cache/flutter_tools.snapshot&rsquo; to
&lsquo;<strong>&lt;YOUR_FLUTTER_ROOT&gt;</strong>/packages/flutter_tools/bin/flutter_tools.dart&rsquo;.
This will compile flutter tools from scratch each time your run this command and
will become quite slow but will give you ability to play with the tool.</p>
<h3 id="packaging-into-an-apk">Packaging into an APK</h3>
<p>Now since we got everything we need for for the app we need to package
everything into a one APK file which then we can install into a real device.
Unfortunately since there are quite a few of related dependencies I first will
get all the dependencies into in one go and not worry about them later. Actually
the amount of all dependencies is quite large but I tried to reduce them to
absolute minimum require to run the app. We will need flutter engine itself and
some android jar files required for the runtime. Here are all the links to files that
needed.</p>

</code></pre><p>First of all create a folder &rsquo;external&rsquo; at the root of our project and inside of
it create two folder &lsquo;jar&rsquo; and &rsquo;lib&rsquo;. Download files 1 and 2 and extract them
inside &rsquo;external&rsquo; folder. The should fill &rsquo;lib&rsquo; folder with require files. They
both contain libflutter.so files one for arm 32 bit and one for 64 bit. This is
the whole flutter engine compiled into a shared library. Once android app starts
it will load this library which in turn will load all required files from
&lsquo;flutter_asset&rsquo; folder and start executing the app.</p>
<p>Next download files 3-9 and put them inside &lsquo;jar&rsquo; folder. The issue here is that
some of these files are aar files and you should extract from it &lsquo;classes.jar&rsquo;
file, put it into the &lsquo;jar&rsquo; files and then rename it it &lsquo;&lt;package_name&gt;.jar&rsquo;. So
let&rsquo;s take as an example &rsquo;tracing-1.1.0.aar&rsquo;. You extract the classes.jar file
from it name it &rsquo;tracing-1.1.0.jar&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So in the the end our &rsquo;external&rsquo; folder should look like this.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>├── jar
│   ├── core-1.10.0.aar
│   ├── core-1.10.0.jar
│   ├── core-common-2.2.0.jar

└── lib
    ├── arm64-v8a
    │   └── libflutter.so
    └── armeabi-v7a
        └── libflutter.so
</code></pre><p>Next we can start just simply assembly step by step our APK file. Let&rsquo;s start
with defining some constants that will help us reduce typing. You should adjust
it acording to your system setup.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>export SDK=&#34;/opt/Android/Sdk&#34;
export BUILD_TOOLS=&#34;${SDK}/build-tools/29.0.2&#34;
export PLATFORM=&#34;${SDK}/platforms/android-33&#34;
export BUILD_DIR=$(realpath &#34;__build&#34;)
export PROJECT_DIR=$(realpath &#34;.&#34;)
</code></pre><p>We will need 2 java files: <strong>MainActivity.java</strong> and
<strong>GeneratedPluginRegistrant.java</strong>. MainActivity is should be placed in our
custom java package and GeneratedPluginRegistrant inside specific flutter
package. In the root folder of our project create &lsquo;java&rsquo; folder and create 2
files there:
&ldquo;java/com/hereket/handmade_flutter/MainActivity.java&rdquo;
&ldquo;io/flutter/plugins/GeneratedPluginRegistrant.java&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is com/hereket/handmade_flutter/MainActivity.java</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>package com.hereket.handmade_flutter;
import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity;
import io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine;

public class MainActivity extends FlutterActivity {}
</code></pre><p>And here is io/flutter/plugins/GeneratedPluginRegistrant.java</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>package io.flutter.plugins;
import io.flutter.Log;
import io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine;

public final class GeneratedPluginRegistrant {
  private static final String TAG = &#34;GeneratedPluginRegistrant&#34;;
  public static void registerWith(FlutterEngine flutterEngine) {
  }
}
</code></pre><h3 id="compile-java-code">Compile java code</h3>
<p>So we will compile java files into their bytecode with <strong>javac</strong>. For that we
will need to add some extra files to the classpath so javac knows about extra
information related to android in general and some info about flutter. The
resulting files will be placed into &lsquo;__build/obj&rsquo; folder.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>CLASSPATH=&#34;${PLATFORM}/android.jar&#34;
CLASSPATH=&#34;$CLASSPATH:${PROJECT_DIR}/external/jar/flutter_embedding_debug-1.0.0.jar&#34;
CLASSPATH=&#34;$CLASSPATH:${PROJECT_DIR}/external/jar/androidx.lifecycle/lifecycle-common-2.5.1.jar&#34;

javac \
    -classpath &#34;$CLASSPATH&#34; \
    -d &#34;$BUILD_DIR/obj&#34; \
    java/com/hereket/handmade_flutter/MainActivity.java \
    java/io/flutter/plugins/GeneratedPluginRegistrant.java \
</code></pre><h3 id="convert-class-files-to-dex">Convert class files to dex</h3>
<p>Android does not work with &lsquo;.class&rsquo; files directly as it is running on dalvik
machine. Davlik requires &lsquo;.class&rsquo; files to be converted to be convert to dex
files. In this step we will convert all our compiled java code into dex and then
merge them with required external java code. This is separate from the step
above as we will adding this code into one dex file which later will be used in
runtime.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>CLASS_FILES=$(find $BUILD_DIR/obj/ -iname &#34;*.class&#34;)
&#34;${BUILD_TOOLS}/d8&#34; $CLASS_FILES  --output $BUILD_DIR/apk/my_classes.jar

pushd $BUILD_DIR/apk

&#34;${BUILD_TOOLS}/d8&#34; my_classes.jar \
    ${PLATFORM}/android.jar \
    ${PROJECT_DIR}/external/jar/flutter_embedding_debug-1.0.0.jar \
    ${PROJECT_DIR}/external/jar/lifecycle-common-2.2.0.jar \
    ${PROJECT_DIR}/external/jar/lifecycle-runtime-2.2.0.jar \
    ${PROJECT_DIR}/external/jar/core-common-2.2.0.jar \
    ${PROJECT_DIR}/external/jar/core-1.10.0.jar \
    ${PROJECT_DIR}/external/jar/tracing-1.1.0.jar \

popd
</code></pre><p>I run this code from &lsquo;apk&rsquo; directory and as a result we will get a &lsquo;classes.dex&rsquo;
file which will contain all our code and all external code in one compact
format.</p>
<h3 id="create-apk-v1-raw">Create apk v1: Raw</h3>
<p>Now we have all the required files and can create a first version of an apk. Apk
is just a zip file off all the required files. Here I used &lsquo;aapt&rsquo; tool from
andoid sdk. Now everybody uses aapt2 but since I learned this stuff at the time
when aapt was the tool to use and I remember how to use I will go with it. From
the the root folder of our project run this command:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&#34;${BUILD_TOOLS}/aapt&#34; package -f -M AndroidManifest.xml -S res \
    -A assets \
    -A $FLUTTER_OUTPUT_DIR \
    -I &#34;${PROJECT_DIR}/external/jar/flutter_embedding_debug-1.0.0.jar&#34; \
    -I &#34;${PLATFORM}/android.jar&#34; \
    -F $BUILD_DIR/handmade_flutter.unsigned.apk $BUILD_DIR/apk/
</code></pre><p>As a result of this command we will get <strong>handmade_flutter.unsigned.apk</strong>. It is
real apk but it won&rsquo;t run on android as it needs some processing before android
will accept it.</p>
<h3 id="create-apk-v2-zipalign">Create apk v2: zipalign</h3>
<p>This step is just a an required optimization step that just aligns files inside
the apk. It is used as an optimization on androids side to load apps faster. If
you you want to dig deep you can look into documentation but I won&rsquo;t dive into
it. Just run this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&#34;${BUILD_TOOLS}/zipalign&#34; -f -p 4 \
    $BUILD_DIR/handmade_flutter.unsigned.apk $BUILD_DIR/handmade_flutter.aligned.apk
</code></pre><p>The result of this command will be a new file named <strong>handmade_flutter.aligned.apk</strong> which will be used
in the next step.</p>
<h3 id="create-apk-v3-final-and-signed">Create apk v3: Final and signed</h3>
<p>Everything is ready. But we need to sign the apk as it is a requirement of
android security system. It is needed for android to verify that for example
if android already has an app with this package name and need to overwrite it,
it could verify that the signer of the original app and this one is the &ldquo;same&rdquo;
person.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&#34;${BUILD_TOOLS}/apksigner&#34; sign --ks keystore.jks \
    --ks-key-alias androidkey --ks-pass pass:android \
    --key-pass pass:android --out $BUILD_DIR/handmade_flutter.apk \
    $BUILD_DIR/handmade_flutter.aligned.apk
</code></pre><p>For this you will need to have your key to be prepare. In the command above it
is named &lsquo;keystore.jks&rsquo;. As a result you will get an APK file <strong>handmade_flutter.aligned.apk</strong>
inside the __build directory. This is full blow, real apk that can be installed
and used on real devices. Of course you cannot upload to playstore as they no
longer accept apk files. If you don&rsquo;t have a key get one in the next step.</p>
<h3 id="extra-create-key">[Extra] Create key</h3>
<p>Just in case if you don&rsquo;t have a key and don&rsquo;t know how to create or don&rsquo;t want to bother with here
is a quick command to create a dummy that will work with previous command.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>keytool -genkeypair -keystore keystore.jks -alias androidkey \
       -validity 10000 -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 \
       -storepass android -keypass android
</code></pre><h3 id="running-app-on-the-device">Running app on the device</h3>
<p>I will not be going over how to install adb if you don&rsquo;t have one then just
upload the apk in any possible way to your device and install directly from
device.</p>
<p>But if you have adb installed you can run this command to install and launch
create applition directly on your device</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>adb install -r $BUILD_DIR/handmade_hero.apk
adb shell am start -n com.hereket.handmade_hero/.MainActivity
</code></pre><p>and you whould have a running flutter application</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Small part of &lsquo;flutter build apk &ndash;debug&rsquo; in one not small article.</p>
<p>Without using &lsquo;flutter&rsquo; command or without any help of &lsquo;gradle&rsquo; we were able to
create a fully funtional flutter app with just some android tools, some dart,
java and bare hands. The idea was just to be able to put together parts and
actually try to understand how they are funtioning. I did cheat a little bit
and didn&rsquo;t decompose the working of flutter tool even further for the
compilation part but the article is already to big to swallow.</p>
<p>The initial goal was to do it myself and learn how it fits together and the
article ti my way to help people get on track of flutter build process a bit
faster.</p>
<p>I decided to go with debug build just because there is more projects I want do
try with this build like communicating with runtime server, partial
recompilation and other procrastination topics. Hope this will help other
procrastinators.</p>
<p><strong>Rework</strong>: Fun part is that when I started writing the article I was testing this whole
thing on flutter 2.19 and in the process I decided to upgrade to flutter 3.0+
and everything stopped working as flutter moved to java 11 and I was using
<strong>dx</strong> which didn&rsquo;t support newer java. And during rewrite the whole script
got smaller which is a win.</p>
