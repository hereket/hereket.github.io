        <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>edit-compile-edit cycle</p>
<p>Normal IDE show errors at the time when you are typing. I don&rsquo;t really like
especially for static pages since compiler can do find all the stupid syntax
errors. I don&rsquo;t like them because it is the same as writing in prose in MS Word.
It always annoys you with not important errors like misspellings, comma and
other stuff that is not integral part of the story. For me the same goes with
programming. Once I am working on solving problem and have some thought process
I don&rsquo;t want to be disrupted by missed semicolon or some syntax error. And thus
one I think I filled my context buffer in my head and need to &ldquo;save&rdquo; I just
compile the program and let compiler tell where I messed up.</p>
<p>This way I can pipeline my work instead of doing thinking about the problem,
fixing silly typos, formating my code to some style and etc. I do coding for
some time, then fix errors, then program, then fix errors and so on. But in vim
usual process was that I write some code, compile it in another window, then
find the line number of error and go back to the vim and try manually to find
it. It was very tedious and made vim very troublesome to use since it did help
me speed typing but then stole back that time during error fixing time.</p>
<p>Around 2014 I came across Casey Muratori video series where he develops a game from
scratch and there I have seen a setup where compiler returns errors to his <strong>emacs</strong>
and he with simple shortcuts could navigate between errors. I was so jealous
that almost switched to emacs but workload at the time stopped me. Then I
learned a bit of vimscript and wrote a little function which does the same
thing and is pretty usefull.</p>
<h2 id="the-process">The process</h2>
<p>First of all in my case for every project or task I prefer to create a <strong>build.sh</strong>
script which does the building. The process to launching it is the same across
all projects but it might contain a lot of different things. For C++ it will
compile it (and sometimes might launch it), for dart it will use dart toolchain,
for android I might build JNI code and push it to remote phone and etc. But in
order not be abstract let&rsquo;s focus on simpole C++ project.</p>
<p>For this I will need two files <strong>main.cpp</strong> and <strong>build.sh</strong>. I will put
main.cpp and build.cpp in &ldquo;project1/src&rdquo; location. Then cd into &lsquo;project1/src&rsquo;
and fill in contents for those files.</p>
<p>main.cpp</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    printf(&#34;Hello world!\n&#34;);

    action();
}
</code></pre><p>build.sh</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>mkdir -p ../build/
pushd ../build/

gcc ../src/main.cpp -o main

popd
</code></pre><p>This version of main.cpp won&rsquo;t work because it has invocation of a function
<strong>action()</strong> and is missing include of &ldquo;stdio.h&gt; (or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->) but it is what we
need. Also we need to make our build.sh file executable.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>chmod +x build.sh
</code></pre><p>Maybe for this setup you might argue that build.sh is not needed but usually
projects are a bit more involved and always using this script just unifies
everything. The the build script is creating a build directory inside root
directory and then &ldquo;cd&rdquo; into it. It is good as all intermediary files will be
created there and not mess our source directory. All this is regular stuff and
everybody does this, some might use make, some cmake but steps are quite
similar. What makes it better is special function that we add in our vimrc.</p>
<h2 id="vim-setup">Vim setup</h2>
<p>The trick is already built in into vim and is called <strong>quickfix</strong> window. You
can read more about it with &ldquo;:h quickfix&rdquo;. It is used to populate with a list of
file locations and can be later used to quickly jump between those.</p>
